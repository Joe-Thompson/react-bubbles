1) Explain what a token is used for.

A token is created once a user has submitted their login credentials  and has been authenticated by the server, that
token is then used to give the user authorization to protected routes, as well as be placed in the header of any axios
call made during that users session.

2) What steps can you take in your web apps to keep your data secure?

The first step would be to create a login component that checks the users credentials and create a token once the user
has been authenticated.  The next step would be to create protected routes that only a logged in user has access to.
Once potential security leak would to leave the token in local storage, the last step is to create a log out component
that once the user is done their token is erased from local storage.

3) Describe how web servers work.

Web servers are computers that store our code for our web apps, the program that web servers run is...web server.  When
a user types in a url of any kind, their modem sends a request to their isp which sends a request to the web server
hoisting that url, once that url receives the request it sends the data back along the same path to the user

4) Which HTTP methods can be mapped to the CRUD acronym that we use when interfacing with APIs/Servers.

C – post request to submit data to the api
R – get request to fetch data from the api
U – put request to update data on the api
D – delete to...well delete data from the api
